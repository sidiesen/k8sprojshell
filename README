PREREQUISITES
=============

- Powershell Core
- .NET Core SDK
- Git

ONBOARDING STEPS
================

- create repo folder (empty git repo: `git init`)
- ensure powershell is installed
    - in new repo root, run `Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([Scriptblock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidiesen/k8sprojshell/master/init.ps1' -Headers @{"Cache-Control"="no-cache"}).Content))`
- in ./src/ create a new solution: `dotnet new sln -n MySolution`
- create a new project: `dotnet new web -n MyProject`
- add the project to the solution: `dotnet sln ./MySolution.sln add ./MyProject/MyProject.csproj`
- edit `repoconfig.json`:
    - config.solutions: `["MySolution"]`
        - should be the solution you just created
        - can be multiple solutions if your application has multiple components
    - config.environments: `[""]`
        - leave empty for now
        - does implicitly include Dev environment, no need to specify that
        - will include all supported Azure regions later (e.g.: `["eastus2","westeurope",...]`)
    - config.defaultSolution: `"MySolution"`
    - solutions:
        - contains a configuration object for every solution in the repo:
            - deploymentname: The name of the Helm deployment (any text, no spaces)
            - rolloutSpecName: The name of the Ev2 rollout (any text, no spaces)
            - serviceGroupName: The name of the Ev2 Service Group (any text, no spaces)
            - ServiceName: The logical name of the service this Solution implements (any text, no spaces)
            
            ```
                "MySolution": {
                    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
                    "deploymentname": "MySolutionDeployment",
                    "rolloutSpecName": "UpdateMySolution",
                    "serviceGroupName": "MySolutionSG",
                    "nginxDeploymentName": "nginx",
                    "ServiceName": "MyService"
                }
            ```
    - tenants:
        - Provide valid subscription IDs
        - "Tenants" in this K8s environment aren't exactly Azure tenants (e.g.: "AME","MSFT"), but rather "deployment targets" identified by the actual Azure tenant and the subscription to use for deployment in the target.
        - e.g.: You can have two different tenants "Dev" and "Test", both live in MSFT, with "Test" deploying to a permanent subscription while "Dev" is deploying to a temporary subscription from the Azure Subscription Library.
        - The "Dev" tenant is mandatory, but other than that you can have as many tenants as you like with any names.
- create directory `src/docker/<solution>`
    - create both Release and Debug Dockerfiles (see sample in `src/docker/sample`)
    - folder structure must stay intact
    - if Dockerfiles have different names than "Dockerfile", reflect the dockerfile name in repoconfig.json under solutions.<solution>.dockerfile
    - for now, only Linux images are supported, Windows image support might be added later
- choose a single project in your repo and mark as default solution by including the following entry in a PropertyGroup:
    - `<IsMainProject>true</IsMainProject>`
